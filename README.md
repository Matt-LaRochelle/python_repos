# python_repos
A list of 30 of the most starred python repositories on GitHub

This program will search through the GitHub database sorting out only the repositories that utilize 
python as the coding language. It then organizes the repos based on how many stars the program got
and draws them to a bar graph inside of an SVG file. The program saves the SVG file to the same directory
the python file is stored in and you can access the bar graph by opening the SVG file in one of your web 
browsers. The graph contains the name of the repo, how many stars it has, and if you hover over the
bar you can also see the details of the repo, exact number of stars, and a link to that repo.
